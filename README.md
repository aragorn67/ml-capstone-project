# ML/AI Capstone Project - Black-Box Optimization Challenge

## Project Overview

This capstone project is part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning 
and Artificial Intelligence. The project focuses on developing and optimizing 
machine learning models within a black-box environment, where I'll work to improve 
model performance through iterative, evidence-based approaches without full 
visibility into the underlying system.

The challenge simulates real-world ML competitions and industry scenarios where 
practitioners must optimize solutions based on outputs and feedback rather than 
complete system transparency.

## Goals

- Develop practical ML model optimization skills in constrained environments
- Apply iterative, evidence-based improvement strategies to enhance model performance
- Document the complete ML workflow from experimentation to optimization
- Build a professional portfolio showcasing ML/AI problem-solving capabilities
- Demonstrate proficiency in core ML techniques and best practices
